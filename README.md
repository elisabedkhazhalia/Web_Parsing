# Hacker News Scraper
This Python script retrieves information from the Hacker News website and saves it into a CSV file. It uses the requests library to send HTTP requests and the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML content.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure that you have the following installed:

1. Python (version 3.6 or above)
2. Requests library (pip install requests)
3. BeautifulSoup library (pip install beautifulsoup4)

## Customization
1. You can modify the url variable to scrape a different website or web page.
2. Adjust the pagination logic by changing the condition in the while loop or modifying the payloads dictionary.
3. Customize the CSV file and column headers by modifying the csv_obj.writerow line.

## Important Notes
The script implements a delay between requests using the sleep function to avoid overwhelming the server. The delay is randomized between 5 to 15 seconds (adjustable in the code).
Please be aware of any applicable terms of use or restrictions when scraping websites. Respect the website's policies and do not use the script for unethical purposes.
